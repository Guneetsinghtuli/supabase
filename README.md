# Accident Detection



This is an app for detecting road accidents using machine learning techniques. This app use a variety of sensors, such as accelerometers and GPS to detect and analyze data related to accidents, such as changes in speed, direction, and impact force. The ultimate goal is to minimize response times and improve outcomes for those involved in accidents. The key challenges in developing effective accident detection systems include ensuring accuracy and reliability of detection, minimizing false positives, and ensuring compatibility with existing emergency response infrastructure.

## Use of Supabase

I implemented Supabase's magic link authentication, simplifying the login process and enhancing the user experience. The SOS list was securely stored in a dedicated table within the Supabase database, allowing efficient management of SOS requests. Supabase's seamless integration and robust features provided a reliable backend infrastructure for my project.

## Features
Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensors: The app uses the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors in a mobile device to detect sudden changes in speed or direction that may indicate a car accident.

SOS: If a car accident is detected, the app automatically sends an emergency alert to pre-configured emergency contacts with the user's location information and a message indicating that an accident has occurred.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following software installed:
